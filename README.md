Game design:  

3D Game, first person game set in a secret temple.  

There will be clues around the room, to help the player guess the correct combination. The passwords will change, every time that the player guesses wrong or the player restarts the level. The clues will have to change every time, that the password changes.  

The password will be 3 characters long every time. 

The player must get to the locked doors and crack the password to open it, by the player must guess the correct combination to progress onto the next level.  

The player can have 3 wrong answers before being kicked out of the temple, however if the player guesses correctly then can then progress onto the next level. There will be 3 â€“ 4 levels before getting to the gold and winning the game. 

The player must use a joy stick, to move around the level to find clues and get to the door. Once the door is open, the player then must move the player to the portal that takes them to the next scene.  

 

If the password is correct, all the lights will flash green and the door will open on screen and the player will progress onto the next level 

If the password is slightly in the wrong order (by 2 character), two of the lights will flash orange and one will flash green 

If the password is completely in the wrong order, all the lights will flash red
